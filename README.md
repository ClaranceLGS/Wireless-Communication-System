# Wireless Communication System 

> **Semester 3 Project** for the Communication Design Project module.

---

## 📚 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a **point-to-point digital wireless communication system** using **software-defined radios (SDR)**.  

### **Key Objectives**:
Transmit the following data types;
1. Binary Stream
2. Image File
3. Audio File

### 👍 **Achievements**:
- We successfully transmitted and received the image and audio files with high accuracy.
- The image and audio were processed and transmitted without significant issues, demonstrating the functionality of the system.

### 👎**Challenges**:
- However, due to some technical difficulties, we were not able to correctly receive the transmitted binary stream.
- Despite this challenge, the project provided valuable insights into the complexities of SDRs and wireless communication.
