# Wireless Communication System 

> **Semester 3 Project** for the Communication Design Project module.

---

## 📚 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a **point-to-point digital wireless communication system** using **software-defined radios (SDR)**.  

### **Key Objectives**:
Transmit the following data types;
1. Binary Stream
2. Image File
3. Audio File

### 👍 **Achievements**:
- We successfully transmitted and received the image and audio files with high accuracy.
- The image and audio were processed and transmitted without significant issues, demonstrating the functionality of the system.

### 👎**Challenges**:
- However, due to some technical difficulties, we were not able to correctly receive the transmitted binary stream.
- Despite this challenge, the project provided valuable insights into the complexities of SDRs and wireless communication.

## 🛠️ **Project Highlights**
- Hardware Used
  1. **BladeRF 2.0 micro xA9** as Transmitter
  2. **RTL-SDR** as Receiver
       
- Software Used
  1. **Python** used for encryption purposes, ensuring the security of the transmitted data.
  2. **Octave** used for packetization, allowing data to be properly formatted for transmission.
  3. **GNU Radio** used for signal processing and transmission of the data through the system.
